Santa\u202fFe\u2019s location means you\u2019ll often fly out of Albuquerque or use a 4\u2011hour drive to reach major hubs.\n- **Climate**: Being far from the ocean gives Santa\u202fFe its distinctive high\u2011altitude, arid climate\u2014hot days, cool nights, and a low humidity that\u2019s markedly different from coastal regions.\n- **Economic & cultural reach**: Its relative isolation from dense urban centers contributes to Santa\u202fFe\u2019s unique blend of art, Native American heritage, and Southwestern architecture, which are distinct from metropolitan trends.\n\n---\n\n### Quick \u201cfrom\u2011here\u2011to\u2011there\u201d cheat sheet\n\n- **To the nearest ocean (Pacific)**: \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f620\u202fmi, \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f10\u202fh by car (no direct highways, so a mix of interstate & US\u2011routes).  \n- **To Albuquerque (state capital)**: \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f60\u202fmi, \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f1\u202fh 20\u202fmin drive.  \n- **To Dallas**: \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f300\u202fmi, \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f5\u202fh 15\u202fmin drive.  \n- **To Seattle**: \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f1\u202f200\u202fmi, \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f20\u202fh drive or 4\u202fh flight.  \n- **To Washington, D.C.**: \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f1\u202f200\u202fmi, \u202f\u2248\u202f\u202f18\u202fh drive or 3\u202fh flight.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nSanta\u202fFe, New\u202fMexico is far from the ocean, the equator, major U.S. metros, and the U.S. capital. Its high\u2011desert location gives it a distinct cultural and climatic identity, but also means you\u2019ll often have to plan travel to reach many of the places people think of as \u201cnearby.\u201d",

Whitney) are still over 200\u202fmi away.\n- **Other states** \u2013 Sacramento sits roughly 120\u202fmi from the Nevada border, 200\u202fmi from Oregon, and 350\u202fmi from Arizona.\n- **International** \u2013 It\u2019s about 2,600\u202fmi from the Mexican border (Tijuana) and 3,200\u202fmi from the Canadian border.\n\nIf you had a different completion in mind\u2014say, \u201cSacramento, California is far from the desert\u201d or \u201cSacramento, California is far from the Pacific Northwest\u201d\u2014just let me know, and I can tailor the answer to fit!",
