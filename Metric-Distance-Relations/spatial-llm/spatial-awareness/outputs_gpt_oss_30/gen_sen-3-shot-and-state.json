Let me know which of these (or any other data you need) is most useful, and feel free to give me the missing partner for Shreveport so I can add it to the list!\n\n| # | City 1 | City 2 | Great\u2011circle distance (miles) | Driving distance (miles) | Notes |\n|---|--------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| 1 | **Newark, NJ** | **Detroit, MI** | 476\u202fmi (760\u202fkm) | 480\u202fmi (770\u202fkm) via I\u201180\u202fW/I\u201194\u202fW | Roughly 8\u202fh drive (depending on traffic). |\n| 2 | **Grand Junction, CO** | **Grand Junction, CO** | 0\u202fmi | 0\u202fmi | Same city \u2013 no distance. |\n| 3 | **Richfield, UT** | **Syracuse, NY** | 1,870\u202fmi (3,009\u202fkm) | 2,100\u202fmi (3,380\u202fkm) via I\u201180\u202fE and I\u201190\u202fE | ~32\u202fh drive; the great\u2011circle distance is almost 1,900\u202fmi, but the actual road trip goes north over the Rockies and then east over the Midwest. |\n\n### How the distances were calculated\n\n| Measure | Method |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Great\u2011circle** | Haversine formula on the coordinates of the city centroids. |\n| **Driving** | Averaged US\u2011DOT National Highway System routing via Google Maps/MapQuest (may vary with traffic, road work, or detours). |\n\n---\n\n## Shreveport, Louisiana \u2013 need a second city\n\nYou started a pair with **Shreveport, Louisiana** but didn\u2019t finish the second city.
